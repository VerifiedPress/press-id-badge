# Brave Browser Extension
[Brave Extensions](https://brave.com/learn/category/browser-extensions/)

Since Brave interacts directly with [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/category/extensions) and does **not** have an extension store of it's own, there will **not** be a separate branch for Brave browsers
