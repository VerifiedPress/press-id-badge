# Vivladi Browser Extension
See [Install an extension in Vivaldi](https://help.vivaldi.com/desktop/appearance-customization/extensions/)

Since Vivaldi interacts directly with [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/category/extensions) and does **not** have an extension store of it's own, there will **not** be a separate branch for Vivaldi browsers
