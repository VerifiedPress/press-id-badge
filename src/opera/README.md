# Testing
Okay, time to test out your extension. For the final extension, you’ll need to package and sign the extension from the Extension Settings page. But the good news is that you don’t need to do this every time you want to test things out — you can test your extension straight from the directory, like so:

1. Go to the browser address bar and type **opera:extensions** (or use the Cmd/Ctrl Shift E shortcut)
2. Check the “Developer Mode” button to enable it.
3. Click on the “Load Unpacked Extension…” button.
4. Select your extension’s directory
