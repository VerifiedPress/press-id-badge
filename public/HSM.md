# HSM (hardware security module) 
A *conceptual-based* USB-based private key wallet that can securely interact with a browser extension‚Äîthink of it like a low-footprint HSM (hardware security module) for credentialed flows. 

## üîê High-Level Architecture

| Component              | Role                                                                 |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| USB Wallet (Firmware)  | Stores private keys securely; handles signing, challenge-response    |
| Browser Extension      | Interfaces with web apps; communicates with USB over WebUSB/WebHID   |
| Protocol Bridge        | Manages message encoding/decoding; validates origin and intent       |
| Registry Interaction   | Resolves credential schemas and signs issuance or proof payloads     |

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Flow

1. **USB Wallet**
   - Choose a microcontroller (e.g. Arduino Nano RP2040 Connect, or FIDO2-compliant dongles)
   - Securely store keys in flash or secure enclave if available
   - Implement challenge-response logic over USB
   - Provide JSON-based message signing interface

2. **Browser Extension**
   - Use WebUSB or WebHID to establish connection with USB device
   - UX layer for detecting connected wallet and presenting credential actions
   - Validate domain, credential schema, and invoke signing flow
   - Optionally cache public keys and resolved capabilities

3. **Message Structure**
   - Use CBOR or JSON-LD to encode credential payloads
   - Support both issuance and verification signatures
   - Define a credential template registry for discoverable schema URIs

4. **Security Considerations**
   - Device-attested public keys
   - Origin-binding on browser side (prevent phishing/unauthorized usage)
   - Tamper checks on USB (boot verification, signature counter)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Optional Features to Enhance

- **Credential-aware billing**: Extension can invoke per-signature invoicing with Stripe
- **Multi-role registry**: Let USB wallet sign claims based on role-specific keys
- **Audit logging**: Capture signed credential events locally and on registry for provenance

# Is using a Hardware Wallet from a third-party really safe?
Here are some notable incidents where **hardware wallets were compromised**, leading to loss of credentials or funds:

---

### üß® 1. **TikTok Sealed Wallet Scam (2025)**
- A user bought a ‚Äúsealed‚Äù Ledger wallet from Douyin (Chinese TikTok).
- The wallet appeared authentic but had **pre-compromised recovery phrases**.
- Attackers drained **$6.9 million** shortly after setup.
- Lesson: Always buy directly from the manufacturer.

---

### üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 2. **Ledger Connect Kit Supply Chain Attack (2023)**
- Hackers accessed a former Ledger employee‚Äôs NPMJS account via phishing.
- They uploaded a **malicious version** of the Ledger Connect Kit used by DApps.
- Users connecting wallets to affected DApps had funds **redirected to hacker wallets**.
- Over **$600,000** was stolen during the brief exploit window.

---

### üß™ 3. **Bybit Incident (2025)**
- A rogue interface disguised malicious transactions sent to Ledger devices.
- Users failed to verify transaction details on the hardware wallet screen.
- Resulted in **unauthorized fund transfers**.

---

### üìß 4. **Trezor Phishing via Support Form (2025)**
- Attackers exploited Trezor‚Äôs support system to send **phishing emails**.
- Emails appeared legitimate and asked users for **wallet backups**.
- No internal breach occurred, but the trust in automated replies was weaponized.

---

### üßæ 5. **Ledger Data Breaches (2020‚Äì2021)**
- Personal info of **270,000 users** leaked due to third-party API vulnerabilities.
- Exposed users to phishing, blackmail, and physical threats.
- French regulators fined Ledger **‚Ç¨750,000** in 2024 for these failures.

### üîê Common Attack Vectors
| Method                     | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Counterfeit Devices       | Fake wallets with pre-set recovery phrases or tampered firmware             |
| Supply Chain Tampering    | Devices intercepted and modified during shipping                            |
| Phishing Emails           | Fake support messages asking for seed phrases or backups                    |
| Malicious Software Kits   | Compromised libraries used by DApps to connect to wallets                   |
| UI Spoofing               | Interfaces that hide malicious transaction details                          |

## Conclusion
While the Press ID Badge extension does not integrate with cryptocurrency, the extension uses a similar process for signing messages using local private keys. While using a third-party wallet provider may seem secure but the moment your private key is out of your possession, compromise possibilities can exist. The simplest hardware wallet is using a USB flash storage with a keychain clip, while a more eloborate version is using a DIY ESP32 HSM connected via Wifi or Bluetooth.
